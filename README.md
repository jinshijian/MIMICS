# MIMICS
MIMICS Code Repository

Created by Will Wieder:

Code for used to generate sumulations for MIMICS in: 

Wieder et al. Geosci. Model Dev. Discuss., 8, 2011–2052, 2015  doi:10.5194/gmdd-8-2011-2015

Data or findings that are based on this model, or it's derevations, please cite the manuscript above

## The `Sandbox` branch is inteded to explore  some of the MIMICS functions and parameterizations
#### MIMICS2_testing_reverseSTODEonly 

_The real utility of this script is to explore sensitivity of the model to parametric changes across a range of sites._

- reads in parameter file
- uses LIDET and LTER observations
- calculates steady state pools
- plots against observations

-------------------------------------------
### Main repo: 
LIDET Simulations require site level observed data (see Table C1 in GMDD manuscript, and associated citations)
Data are included here as a seperate .csv file

Results presented in Fig. 2 & Table 1 also require LIDET observations, 
These data were provided by Bil Parton & published in: 
Bonan et al. Global Change Biology, 19, 957–974, 2013 doi: 10.1111/gcb.120312013  
[available on request]

Updates to the MIMICS code are archived for a sensitivy analysis led by Ben Sulman looking at changes in soil C pools in response to environmental perturbations in idealized simulations. Files used for these runs include
- MIMICS2_testing_reverse_modfPHYS_Sept7_2016.R (source code)
- Test_SITES_1.csv (site conditions for idealized experiments)
- parameters_LIDET-MIM-REV_test_lowKM.csv (model parameters)
